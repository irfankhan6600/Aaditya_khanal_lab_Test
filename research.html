                              CO₂ geo-storage involves the permanent sequestration of carbon dioxide in subsurface formations to 
                              mitigate climate change. At Aaditya Khanal Lab, we use a combination of numerical simulations and 
                              data-driven approaches to explore the geochemical processes that occur during carbon capture and storage (CCS).

                              In our lab, we are dedicated to advancing the understanding of carbon dioxide (CO₂) storage 
                              in deep saline aquifers as a means of mitigating anthropogenic emissions. We employ reactive 
                              transport models and numerical simulations to study how geochemical reactions influence 
                              reservoir properties and CO₂ trapping mechanisms. Our work explores the role of mineral 
                              precipitation/dissolution, the impact of capillary pressure, and the effects of brine composition 
                              on CO₂ mineralization. Through the use of proxy models and Monte Carlo simulations, we address 
                              uncertainties in reaction kinetics. Our research provides critical insights into optimizing CO₂ 
                              sequestration strategies by understanding fluid-rock interactions and enhancing CO₂ retention 
                              within geological formations.

                              Our lab focuses on advancing Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage (CCUS) by integrating machine 
                              learning (ML) to optimize CO₂ sequestration in deep saline aquifers and other geological formations. 
                              We develop physics-based proxy models using techniques to predict CO₂ trapping mechanisms, including 
                              residual, solubility, and mineral trapping. By analyzing various injection strategies 
                              (e.g., Water-Alternating-Gas, continuous, and intermittent) and assessing key geological parameters 
                              (porosity, permeability, capillary pressure), our models achieve high predictive accuracy (R² > 0.99) 
                              while significantly reducing computational time. Our work also addresses uncertainty quantification 
                              and identifies influential factors affecting CO₂ storage performance, helping optimize sequestration 
                              operations and support large-scale implementation of CCUS technologies.

                           <h4>Investigating CO₂ Trapping Mechanisms Using Hele-Shaw Cell Experiments</h4>

                           <p>
                              We investigate the mechanisms that enhance CO₂ storage efficiency in saline aquifers, focusing on density-driven 
                              convection and dissolution trapping. Through 2D Hele-Shaw cell experiments, we visualize how CO₂ dissolves into 
                              brine under varying conditions such as ionic concentrations, reservoir permeability, injection locations, dipping angles, 
                              and permeability heterogeneity. Our research demonstrates that salts accelerate the onset of convection and influence 
                              convective finger patterns, while heterogeneities like flow barriers and fractures affect CO₂ sweep efficiency and channeling. 
                              We also analyze the impact of reservoir permeability on CO₂ dissolution dynamics, identifying preferential dissolution paths 
                              and quantifying the relationship between finger growth rates and permeability. By combining experimental observations and 
                              spectrophotometric methods to measure convective flux, we improve the understanding of CO₂ transport and storage behavior in 
                              heterogeneous formations, contributing to safer and more effective long-term carbon sequestration strategies.

                     <p>Digital rock physics bridges the gap between traditional laboratory analyses and advanced computational modeling, 
                        offering innovative solutions to understand and predict the behavior of fluids in porous media. At Aaditya Khanal 
                        Lab, we utilize cutting-edge techniques to evaluate reservoir rock properties critical for applications such as 
                        hydrocarbon recovery, carbon dioxide storage, and underground hydrogen storage (UHS). Our research employs 
                        microcomputed tomography (micro-CT) imaging and machine learning frameworks to streamline the prediction of key 
                        rock properties such as porosity, pore surface area, and throat area. By leveraging segmented digital rock images, 
                        our workflow delivers computationally efficient and accurate models for pore-scale analysis, significantly reducing 
                        the cost and time compared to traditional core-based methods.
                     </p>
                        Our studies extend beyond pore-scale analyses to tackle critical challenges in UHS and CCUS, particularly understanding 
                        capillary trapping mechanisms. We use digital rock physics and pore-network modeling to analyze the relationship 
                        between microscopic pore structures and gas trapping behavior.Through a combination of data-driven models, advanced 
                        imaging, and reservoir-scale simulations, Aaditya Khanal Lab is shaping the future of digital rock physics and its 
                        application to sustainable energy technologies.

                        Our lab focuses on advancing the understanding and optimization of Underground 
                        Hydrogen Storage (UHS) as a viable large-scale energy storage solution to support 
                        the transition to a net-zero carbon future. We investigate how hydrogen behaves 
                        in subsurface porous media, emphasizing the influence of pore structures, reservoir 
                        heterogeneity, and rock-fluid interactions on hydrogen retention and loss mechanisms. 
                        Our research uses experimental approachess, alongside numerical simulations to analyze 
                        capillary trapping, relative permeability hysteresis, and mass transfer processes. 
                        We quantify the fraction of unrecoverable hydrogen due to capillary trapping, evaluate 
                        the impact of reservoir properties (such as porosity and permeability), and study the 
                        effects of geological factors like dipping angles and fracture networks. Our work 
                        identifies critical parameters affecting hydrogen loss, such as dissolution, diffusion, 
                        and reservoir boundaries, and aims to inform the safe, efficient, and economical selection 
                        of UHS sites. By bridging pore-scale analysis with reservoir-scale behavior, we contribute 
                        to enhancing the reliability of hydrogen storage systems and support the development of a 
                        sustainable hydrogen economy.

                        Microfluidics analysis plays a crucial role in understanding the intricate mechanisms 
                        of Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage (CCUS) and Underground Hydrogen Storage (UHS) 
                        at the pore scale. By utilizing microfluidic devices, we can visualize and quantify fluid 
                        dynamics, capillary trapping, and the interactions between injected gases (CO₂ or H₂) and 
                        brine within subsurface porous media. These experiments enable detailed observation of 
                        gravitational instabilities, dissolution processes, and the impact of pore structure
